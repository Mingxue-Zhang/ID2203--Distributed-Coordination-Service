### Data frame

> As we all know, network connections like TCP connection mostly are byte stream. The byte stream, in our system, should be converted into `frames`. Each `frame` is a data unit. The frame has no semantics except data. Command parsing and implementation will be performed at a higher level (compared with frame parsing level, thinking about HTTP).

The basic structure of Frame looks like this:

```rust
enum Frame {
    Simple(String),
    Error(String),
    Integer(u64),
    Bulk(Bytes),
    Null,
    Array(Vec<Frame>),
}
```

#### Bytes to Frame 

`ddbb` use a series of encodeing tags to cast bytes into `frame` which are similar to the protocol used by `redis`, to see details: [RESP protocol spec | Redis](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec/)

APIs supplied by: 

- `Frame::check()`
- `Frame::parse()`
- `Frame::deserialize()`

#### Frame to Bytes

APIs supplied by:

- `Frame::serialize()`

### Data structure

`ddbb` has different data structures for different view of the system.

```rust
/// For ddbb user.
pub enum DataEntry {}

/// For omni-paxos.
pub enum LogEntry {}

/// For ddbb_client and ddbb_sever.
pub enum CommandEntry {}

/// For ddbb_client and ddbb_server
pub enum MessageEntry {}
```

 In order to transport data using network connection, such data structures shoud be casted to `frame` and then to bytes.

### Connection

`ddbb` uses `tokio::net::TcpStream` to build network connection, but can be replaced by any interface of bytes stream.

The structure of data transported by network looks like this:
